# Austin-MetroBike-Analysis

## Introduction
This GitHub repository hosts the Austin MetroBike Data Analytics Project. Austin MetroBike is a non-profit bike sharing program owned by the City of Austin, Capital Metro, and Bike Share of Austin. The MetroBike initiative aims to provide accessible, eco-friendly transportation options across the city, enhancing urban mobility and supporting sustainable urban lifestyles. This project explores patterns of bike usage, user preferences, and operational insights to enhance the efficiency and user experience of the MetroBike program. 

## Project objectives
This analysis aims to answer key questions that can help optimize bike-sharing operations and enhance user experience. These questions include:

+ What are the peak hours for bike usage?
+ How does bike usage vary by day of the week or month?
+ Are there seasonal trends in bike usage?
+ How do bikes move across the city (patterns of bike flow)?
+ How does bike usage correlate with council districts?
+ Are there areas in the city that might benefit from more kiosks or docks?
+ Are there any patterns in trip durations based on checkout and return locations?
+ What is the average trip duration, and how does it vary over time?
+ Is there a preference for electric vs conventional bikes?
+ How does the usage of different bike types vary over time?
+ Which kiosks are most popular for bike checkouts and returns?

## Data 
The MetroBike data is maintained by the Austin Transportation and Public Works department within the Data and Technology Services Division. Data collection began in December 2013 and is updated monthly. The dataset used in this analysis has over 2M entries.

The cleaning and merging of datasets is outlined in the MetroBike Data Cleaning document. 

## Methodology
The analysis employs Python for data processing and exploratory analysis. Key steps include:

+ Relationship Explorations through Visualization
+ Geographical Analysis
+ Supervised Machine Learning: Regression
+ Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering
+ Time Series Analysis

## Deliverables
The repository contains the following deliverables:

+ [Python Code]: Scripts used for data analysis.
+ [Excel Report]: A comprehensive report encompassing analysis methods, visualizations, and insights.
+ [Tableau Dashboard]: A dashboard with interactive visualizations of the data that highlights key metrics and provides insights.
